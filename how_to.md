# macOS Tips

## It's better to use Homebrew's python even there is an apple python. 2018/08/16

It's helpful to read the information given by installing python with Homebrew.

## zsh: non-standard shell error 2018/08/16

Getting the error when trying to change mac terminal to use zsh:

```chsh: /usr/local/bin/zsh: non-standard shell```

Open ```/etc/shells``` by ```sudo vim /etc/shells```

Added  ```/usr/local/bin/zsh``` to the end.

## pandas: RuntimeWarning: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. 2018/08/16

```pip install --no-binary all```

[StarOverflow Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40845304/runtimewarning-numpy-dtype-size-changed-may-indicate-binary-incompatibility)

It's only on Py2. Py3 doesn't have this warning.

Reinstall with previous version also works. ```numpy<=1.14.5``` or ```pandas<=0.23.0``` 

## Tensorflow: pip install tensorflow 2018/08/16

Note the version of python. Python2 works fine with ```pip install tensorflow```. It doesn't work for Python3.7 for now.
